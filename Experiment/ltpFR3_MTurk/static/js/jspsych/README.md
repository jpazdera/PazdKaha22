jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser. jsPsych simplifies the process of coding browser-based experiments by providing a set of flexible plugins that define different kinds of tasks a subject could complete during an experiment. By assembling different plugins together and customizing the parameters of each, it is possible to create many different types of experiments.

Response times
--------------

Wondering if jsPsych can be used for research that depends on accurate response time measurement? In general, the answer is yes. Response time measurements in jsPsych (and JavaScript in general) are comparable to those taken in standard lab software like Psychophysics Toolbox and E-Prime. Response times measured in JavaScript tend to be a little bit longer (10-40ms), but have similar variance. See the following references for extensive work on this topic.
