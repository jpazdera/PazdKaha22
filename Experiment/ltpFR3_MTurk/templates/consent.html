                    You have been invited to take part in a research study being
                    conducted by the Computational Memory Lab at the University
                    of Pennsylvania. In this study, you will see or hear lists
                    of words, and later be asked to recall them. You will also
                    be asked to complete a series of simple addition problems
                    before each list. Full instructions will be provided before
                    the study, and you will be given the opportunity to practice
                    the task before the main phase of the experiment begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Due to the inclusion of auditory stimuli in this task, it is
                    important that you have the volume on your computer turned
                    on and set loud enough to hear the words and sounds that we
                    will be presenting. The experiment will begin with an audio
                    test, which will give you the opportunity to adjust your
                    volume accordingly. If you would like to participate, but
                    are currently in a noisy environment or are otherwise unable
                    to complete an auditory task at the moment, please decline
                    this HIT until a later time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The experiment will last approximately 50-60 minutes, not
                    counting breaks. The only minor risk of the study is fatigue
                    from completing the task. There will be opportunities to
                    rest between trials, in case you need to take a break at any
                    point. You will be given up to two and a half hours to
                    complete the study before the HIT expires. You must
                    participate throughout all trials of the experiment (i.e.
                    answering math problems, making recalls when prompted) for
                    us to mark the HIT as complete. We will mark HITs as
                    complete within two business days.

                    Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may stop
                    the experiment at any time. If you have any questions about
                    your rights as a research participant, or about this study
                    in general, please contact the principal investigator:
