	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.

	The second part of the ad displays after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website. This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <p>
									The Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania
									Psychology Department is seeking online participants for a
									research study that will investigate human memory. The only
									requirements are that you are a native English speaker and
									that you are at least 18 years old.
									</p>
									<p>
									Participants will be asked to learn and remember lists of
									printed and spoken words. The task will take appoximately
									50-60 minutes, not counting time spent resting between
									lists, and will pay $7.50.
							    </p>
									<p>
									Please contact us by email at kahanalab@gmail.com with
									any questions.
									</p>
									<p style="font-weight:500;">
									Note that this task contains some auditory stimuli, and
									cannot be completed without headphones or speakers.
									</p>
									<!--
							    <div class="alert alert-danger" style='background-color: #d6eef9; border-color: #d6eef9; color: black'>
									This task can only be completed once.<br><br>
									If you have already completed this task, the system will not
									allow you to run it again. If this task looks familiar, please
									return the HIT to allow someone else to participate.<br><br>
									Otherwise, click the "Accept HIT" button on the MTurk to continue.

									You should thus show them instructions to begin the

									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
