I also noticed that a lot of words could be grouped together. So, if I remembered one word it seemed easier to remember another. I'd also try to remember things based on location. Example, if a group said stove, then I would think kitchen, which would in turn help me remember some foods, etc. Sometimes this got in the way, because my mind would see one word and then relate it to a word that was in a former study. Then I had to try and remember if I just saw the word or if I saw it earlier. I also had to take breaks for many reasons. One being that I have health issues, which makes it much, much more difficult to concentrate, to sit up, and to type. I also took some breaks to try and get some of the former words out of my head. I found it easier to recall words at the end, because I could visualize and connect previous words without worrying about whether it was in the current group. I probably would have written some things down, but I didn't know we were allowed to do that. Thanks for an interesting project!",0,0
