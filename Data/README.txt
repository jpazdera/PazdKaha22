DATA FILE SUMMARY

- events: 

    Events files contain the raw session logs from each participant. These were either extracted 
    from the SQLite database generated by psiTurk or were directly written by the experiment (we 
    switched from the former to the latter to reduce the stress on the database).

- data: [WE RECOMMEND USING THESE FILES FOR CONDUCTING YOUR OWN ANALYSES!]

    Data files contain the processed form of the data from each participant, formatted for usage 
    with our lab's Python Behavioral Toolbox (pybeh) package: https://github.com/pennmem/pybeh
    Note that these files do contain data from the practice trials, so to exclude these you should
    drop the first two rows of each data matrix (and the first two items of 1D arrays indicating
    condition types, such as "pres_rate"). For details on how these files are generated from events
    files, see the Processing directory. Each data file contains the following fields:
    
    [Condition Labels]
    subject: Length-18 list indicating which participant generated the data from each trial.
    pres_mod: Length-18 list indicating the presentation modality of each trial ('v' or 'a').
    list_len: Length-18 list indicating the length of the list presented on each trial (12 or 24).
    pres_rate: Length-18 list indicating the presentation rate of each trial (800 or 1600).
    dist_dur: Length-18 list indicating the duration of the distractor task on each trial 
                (12000 or 24000).
    
    [Presented Item Info]
    pres_words: 18 x 24 matrix indicating the word presented in each serial position on each trial
        (0-padded).
    recalled: 18 x 24 matrix indicating whether each presented item was correctly recalled 
        (0=No, 1=Yes, NaN-padded).
    ffr_recalled: 18 x 24 matrix indicating whether each presented item was recalled during final 
        free recall (0=No, 1=Yes, NaN-padded).
    
    [Recalled Item Info]
    rec_words: 18 x MR matrix indicating the order in which words were recalled on each trial 
        (MR=Max number of recalls on any trial; 0-padded).
    serialpos: 18 x MR matrix indicating the serial position in which each recalled word was
        presented (ranging from 1-24; small negative integers indicate a
        prior list intrusion from that number of lists back; -999 indicates an 
        extra-list intrusion; 0-padded).
    rt: 18 x MR matrix indicating the number of milliseconds after the beginning of the recall
        period each word was recalled (0-padded).
    intrusions: 18 x MR matrix indicating whether each recall was an intrusion (-1 indicates
        extra-list intrusion, positive integer indicates prior-list intrusion from
        that number of lists back, 0 indicates correct recall or padding).
    
    [Final Free Recall Info]
    ffr_rec_words: Length-NR array indicating the order in which words were recalled during
        final free recall (NR=Number of recalls during FFR).
    ffr_serialpos: Length-NR array indicating the serial positions in which each final free
        recalled word was presented (ranging from 1-24; -999 indicates an extra-list intrusion).
    ffr_pres_trial: Length-NR array indicating which trial number each final free recalled word 
        was presented on (ranging from 1-18; -999 indicates an extra-list intrusion). 
    ffr_rt: Length-NR array indicating the number of milliseconds after the beginning of the final
        free recall period each word was recalled (0-padded).
    
    [Miscellaneous]
    math_correct: 18 x MP array indicating whether each distractor task problem was answered
        correctly (MP=max problems completed on any trial; false-padded).

- stats: 

    Stats files contain a variety of behavioral statistics (e.g., serial position curves, 
    probability of first recall, intrusion counts, etc.) summarizing the participant's behavior 
    on each type of list. For details on how these files are generated using the data files, see 
    the Processing directory. Most entries do not relate to our paper, but were used as part of
    automated subject reports during testing. Grand average stats are included in the all_*.json
    files. The entries are as follows, with many subdivided by condition:
    
    [Recall Probability Stats]
    spc: Serial position curve (recall probability as a function of serial position).
    spc_fr1: Serial position curve over trials where recall began from serial position 1.
    spc_frl4: Serial position curve over trials where recall began from last 4 serial positions.
    ffr_spc: Serial position curve for final free recall.
    pfr: Probability of first recall.
    psr: Probability of second recall.
    ptr: Probability of third recall.
    prec: Overall probability of recall.
    pffr: Overall probability of recalling words during final free recall.
    pffr_rec: Overall probability of recalling previously-recalled words during final free recall.
    pffr_unrec: Overall probability of recalling previously-unrecalled words during final free recall.
    
    [Intrusion Stats]
    elis: Average extra-list intrusions per trial.
    reps: Average repetitions (repeated recalls) per trial.
    plis: Average prior-list intrusions per trial.
    pli_recency: Average recency of prior-list intrusions.
    plis_2factor: In Experiment 1, the expected prior-list intrusions per trial, conditional on that
        type of intrusion being possible. Organized into modality types [[VV, VA], [AV, AA]].
    pli_recency_2factor: In Experiment 1, the expected recency of prior-list intrusions, conditional
        on that type of intrusion being possible. Organized into modality types [[VV, VA], [AV, AA]] 
        for each number of lists back.
    
    [Clustering Stats]
    crp_early: Lag-conditional response probability for first few recalls.
    crp_late: Lag-conditional response probability for recalls after the first few.
    temp_fact: Temporal clustering factor (Polyn et al., 2009).
    sem_fact: Semantic clustering factor (Polyn et al., 2009).
    
    [Timing Stats]
    irt: Inter-response times as a function of the number of items recalled.
    irt_sp_excl: Special version of the IRT which excludes trials where the final recall occurred 
        within the final 10 seconds of the recall period.

    [Miscellaneous]
    rec_per_trial: Fraction of items recalled on each trial.
    math_per_trial: Number of distractor problems solved correctly on each trial.
